Getting started with Web Scraping using BeautifulSoup.

1. In IMDB.py I've scraped over 2000 movies from Imdb websites inclusing their meta scores, IMDB rating and Year in which they were released (Reference - Dataquest.io)

2. In K-means.ipynb, I've implemented segmentation of Annual Income and Spending Score for an online retail store using K-means Clustering Algorithm
